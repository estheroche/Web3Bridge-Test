# SWAP CONTRACT

A Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) is a smart contract protocol used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to facilitate automated swapping of tokens. It maintains a fixed product of token reserves, ensuring that as one token is traded for another, the ratio between them changes. Users can swap tokens directly through the CPMM contract, and the system automatically calculates the exchange rate based on the current reserve balances. CPMMs provide liquidity and enable decentralized trading without relying on traditional order books, making them a crucial component of decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems
